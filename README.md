# HeadLift
An OpenSCAD model for a bicycle crown bearing spacer to "slacken" the steering geometry of a threadless, 1 1/4" bicycle.

## Background
HeadLift is a bicycle component/accessory that allows the "slackening" of the steering geometry by raising the heaight of the crown race bearing on the bicycle fork. It is only suitable for inch-and-a-quarter, threadless steerers and is not recommended to be adpted to older 1 inch "quill" stem steering.

The device works by spacing the crown race bearing 40mm higher on the bicycle's fork, sitting snugly over the fork's crown race seat and providing a new crown race seat 40mm further up the fork steerer. This lifts the bicycle frame's head tube, slackening the steering and seat tube angles towards a more modern mountain bike geometry. Think of it as like "suspension correcting" rigid forks to suspension fork height. It was originally designed for use in a 90s mountain bike restomod I'm working on, creating a modern, compact, 650B touring bicycle that breaks down into an airline standard large suitcase, along with parts for using that suitcase as a trailer. 

Others who like tinkering with old bike frames to create new bikes that ride ike modern bikes may find this a useful accessory in restoring/reviving older bicycles from the late 90s onwards.

## Why?

There is a trend at the moment to restore or modify old 90s mountain bikes as modern bikepacking, touring or gravel bikes. The original mountain bikes, being built up from discarded beach cruisers and budget commuters, there was a tendency to a more road oriented geometry. This is probably one reason they're popular as adventure bikes, as these need to have sure-footed handling, rather than being super responsive on impossible terrain at speed. However, in the gravel and ATB realm, adventure bikers may find they need a more modern twitchiness when the trail gets more "gnarly." Not necissarily downhill racing responsiveness, but definitely more responsive than a road commuter. 90s and earlier frames are less slack and more stable, so that "real steal" Giant or Shogun might not suit a more aggressive rider or terrain. Headlift is an experiment in making classic steel frames more adaptable to different terrain.

For example, my Giant Sedona will probably be mostly used for classic bicycle touring on sealed or gravel roads. In this format, with a classic, 4x pannier setup, it'll provide more comfortable ride in it's more road-like standard geometry. If I want to do a more remote weekender, with some unpredictable, aggressive descents, that are still well made trails, I can remove a few spacers from my stack, lift the crown race by installing HedLift, and put it back together again. Now I gave a slacker head and seatpost angle that keeps my weight further back for more rugged descending. My bike I'm using as the example here also has a dopper post.

## History
On this Giant Sedona restomod, it's a 16" frame I recued from a kerbside recycling pile in my neighbourhood. I'm 182cm (a six footer) so it would normally be considered way too small for me but, with a long base dropper, an uncut steerer and a riser handlebar, it's become an excellent compromise between a small wheel folding bike and a proper touring bike. Frame only, it fits diagonally in a TSA specced miximum size souitcase, with room for 650b or 26er wheels. The said case is deep enough to take all the parts, including fork, bars and a few trailer parts, drawbar, 16" wheels, axle. The bike hides inside a suitcase, with a pannier rack, for flying, my maximum size cabin bag fits inside the suitcase in trailer mode. I can sucure the suitcase in a locker or with a hotel, repack my cabin bag into panniers and go bikepacking, returning to the hotel to recover the luggage and return to trailer touring for the next road leg. 

All the while never having to pay for expensive "sporting equipment" baggage prices. Being able to change the head angle, using a head shim system like HeadLift, means I can have a bike in road gemotry for pulling the trailer/suitcase, but have a more lively bike where I feel like a bit of trail fun. The convertible suitcase/trailer also allows me to ride trains and buses without standing out or breaking rules. This is an idea I've been investigating since I had to leave a bike in Vietnam. (Pro tip, never travel in Vietnam during Tet!) Had I had a rig like this, I could have got my bike on the train I needed to catch to make up time. (Another pro tip - allow at least twice the time you think you need, and twice the money, for **any** overseas trip!)

## Usage
HeadLift should be machined or 3D printed from 316 stainless steel or, if saving so few grams is that important, aluminium. However, 316 stainless is stronger and therefore more suited to this application in one of the highest stress pivot points on a bicycle. If 3D printed in stainless steel, the finish is precice and a rough matte, light greay. The matte texture will hold primer and paint well. It can also be powder coated but, for either finish, I'd not recommend coating the inside, as this is a precise fit, especially where the bottom of the HeadLift sits snugly over the bearing race seat, at the fork crown.

You do not need 2 crown bearings! Headlift is designed to replace the bottom crown race seat, position this 40mm higher. After disassembling the head stack, removing the stem, spacers and frame, simply remove the existing, replaceable crown race from the fork crown, slip the Headlift over the steerer tube and slid it down to sit firmly around and against the crown race seat. Then, if not damages by removal, place the original crown race on the crown race seat of the HeadLift and reassemble the stack in reverse order of disassembly, ensureing handlebars are perpendicular to the frame, that the are the right amont of spacer to have stem proud of the steerer by a millimetre or 2, then tighten the stem cap to remove slack from the stack and lock down the stem by tightening it to the stem via its clamping bolts. Diagrams/photos will be added as I complete the prototype instal in the next week or so.

## Availability and Liability
This accessory has been designed to be 3D printed using one of the online metal printing service providers, but could also be turned from aluminium or steel tube stock, on a benchtop lathe, if you have access to such materials or tools. If you upload the design to a commercial 3D printing service, the wall thicknesses of the bearing race seat may spawn a "thickness error." My prototype has been successfully printed by JLC3DP and is awaiting installation on my '95 Giant Sedona with no apparent issues, but there is a process of review and approval where, if you want to accept the risks you have to note this at the time of uploading, or when they inform you the print may fail. This absolves them from responsibility if the failure occurs. They're usually very good about it with these sorts of parts.

The safety of the part is pretty OK. It's all held in compression, fits snug on a standard fork bearing seat and the upper bearing seat nicely takes a modern, aluminium race. That said, if you use this design you must accept all responsibility for your choice to do s and any failure, injury or liability for your choice to use it. I am only an amateur engineer and cannot accept any responsibility conditions arising in use where I have no control over application, especially in regard to any subsequent modification. By using this design, you agree to accept all responsibility for failure, accident, injury or death arising.

The commercial use modifications to the licence, forbidding commercial use, apply to at-scale industrial manufacturing, not to local bike shops or artisinal frame builders working on clients' bikes. My aim for my designs being publicly displayed here is to share with the alt-cycling community. I'm happy for at-scale, industrial production of my designs to be "a thing" but not without recognition of my work or rights.
