## Background
HeadLift is a bicycle component/accessory that allows the "slackening" of the steering geometry by raising the heaight of the crown race bearing on the bicycle fork. It is only suitable for inch-and-a-quarter, threadless steerers and is not recommended to be adpted to older 1 inch "quill" stem steering.

The device works by spacing the crown race bearing 40mm higher on the bicycle's fork, sitting snugly over the fork's crown race seat and providing a new crown race seat 40mm further up the fork steerer. This lifts the bicycle frame's head tube, slackening the steering and seat tube angles towards a more modern mountain bike geometry. Think of it as like "suspension correcting" rigid forks to suspension fork height. It was originally designed for use in a 90s mountain bike restomod I'm working on, creating a modern, compact, 650B touring bicycle that breaks down into an airline standard large suitcase, along with parts for using that suitcase as a trailer. 

Others who like tinkering with old bike frames to create new bikes that ride ike modern bikes may find this a useful accessory.

## Availability and Liability
This accessory has been designed to be 3D printed using one of the online metal printing service providers, but could also be turned from aluminium or steel tube stock, on a benchtop lathe, if you have access to such materials or tools. If you upload the design to a commercial 3D printing service, the wall thicknesses of the bearing race seat may spawn a "thickness error." My prototype has been successfully printed by JLC3DP and is awaiting installation on my '95 Giant Sedona with no apparent issues, but there is a process of review and approval where, if you want to accept the risks you have to note this at the time of uploading, or when they inform you the print may fail. This absolves them from responsibility if the failure occurs. They're usually very good about it with these sorts of parts.

The safety of the part is pretty OK. It's all held in compression, fits snug on a standard fork bearing seat and the upper bearing seat nicely takes a modern, aluminium race. That said, if you use this design you must accept all responsibility for your choice to do s and any failure, injury or liability for your choice to use it. I am only an amateur engineer and cannot accept any responsibility conditions arising in use where I have no control over application, especially in regard to any subsequent modification. By using this design, you agree to accept all responsibility for failure, accident, injury or death arising.

The commercial use modifications to the licence, forbidding commercial use, apply to at-scale industrial manufacturing, not to local bike shops or artisinal frame builders working on clients' bikes. My aim for my designs being publicly displayed here is to share with the alt-cycling community. I'm happy for at-scale, industrial production of my designs to be "a thing" but not without recognition of my work or rights.
